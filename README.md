In the current advanced world, e-commerce comes into the limelight by providing goods to customers at their doorsteps without stepping out. Now that so many shoppers use the internet to make purchases, customer opinions have increased in significance when deciding to buy an item. Yet, sorting through hundreds of customer reviews to comprehend a product or its features is a lengthy process. However, using machine learning, especially supervised learning methods, we can do this task efficiently. This project uses the Amazon Product Reviews dataset. By leveraging AWS services such as IAM, Amazon S3, SageMaker, Athena, and CloudWatch, the project leverages machine learning and cloud computing to predict product review ratings based on customer feedback. Models such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, KNN and Random Forest are trained, with Logistic Regression achieving the highest accuracy. Deployed as a endpoint on SageMaker, the system enables rapid and accurate prediction of review ratings, assisting customers in decision-making
